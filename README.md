# Hangman

This repository contains the simple hangman game. To start, simply try running the python script like so:
```
python hangman.py
```
The number of letters in the word to be guessed will be indicated and you will be prompted to guess a letter. You have up to 8 wrong attempts before the hangman is finished and you have lost the game. Do your best to save the little guy!
